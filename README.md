# A. Bear and Big Brother

Bear Limak wants to become larger than his brother Bob. Currently, Limak weighs `a` and Bob weighs `b`. It is guaranteed that Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles every year. Determine after how many full years Limak will weigh strictly more than Bob.

**Input:**
- A single line containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weights of Limak and Bob respectively.

**Output:**
- Print a single integer representing the number of years after which Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:**
**Output:**
**Explanation:** Initially, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7. After 1 year, Limak weighs 12 (4 * 3) and Bob weighs 14 (7 * 2). After 2 years, Limak weighs 36 (12 * 3) and Bob weighs 28 (14 * 2). Limak becomes heavier than Bob after 2 years.

2. **Input:**
**Output:**
**Explanation:** After 1 year, Limak weighs 12 and Bob weighs 18. After 2 years, Limak weighs 36 and Bob weighs 36. After 3 years, Limak weighs 108 and Bob weighs 72. Limak becomes heavier than Bob after 3 years.

3. **Input:**
**Output:**
**Explanation:** After 1 year, Limak weighs 3 and Bob weighs 2. Limak becomes heavier than Bob after 1 year.
